# UnityGame

This is the logic scripts to a small local-multiplayer sidescrolling platformer game in Unity3d.

The game revolves around sprite based characters batteling in arenas where items and equipment are dispersed.

The game attempts to use items and equipment to radicly alter the way your charecter moves and interacts with the level and players with items ranging from realistic/sci-fi guns, jetpacks, wall-jump-boots, paracheuts etc...
The plan is to make these equipables dynamic enough to make editing them ingame possible.
